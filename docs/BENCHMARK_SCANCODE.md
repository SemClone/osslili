- **Platform**: macOS 15.6.1 (ARM64)
- **Date**: October 15, 2025

## Methodology

### Test Scenarios

1. **Initial Comparison**: ScanCode scan of 4 COPYING files vs OSLILI full directory scan
2. **Sample Comparison**: ScanCode scan of 29 representative files (COPYING files + sample .c files)
3. **Directory Analysis**: OSLILI scan of entire ffmpeg-8.0 directory
4. **Real-world Testing**: Both tools on `/Users/ovalenzuela/Downloads/` directory

### Scanning Configuration

**ScanCode Command:**
```bash
scancode --license --copyright --json-pp output.json /path/to/ffmpeg-8.0/ --processes 4 --timeout 60
```

**OSLILI Command:**
```bash
oslili /path/to/ffmpeg-8.0 --output-format evidence
```

## Copyright Detection

| Tool | Copyright Notices Found | Unique Holders |
|------|------------------------|----------------|
| **ScanCode** | 30 | ~10 |
| **OSLILI** | 790 | ~70 |

**Key Finding**: OSLILI extracted **26x more copyright notices** with better holder identification and year parsing.

## Detection Methods Comparison

### ScanCode Detection Methods
- **2-aho algorithm**: 93% (pattern matching)
- **1-hash**: 7% (exact file matching)

### OSLILI Detection Methods
- **Keyword**: 47% (enhanced pattern matching)
- **Tag**: 27% (SPDX identifiers)
- **Hash**: 13% (exact matching)
- **Regex**: 13% (complex patterns)

**Analysis**: OSLILI uses a more balanced multi-method approach, while ScanCode relies heavily on the Aho-Corasick algorithm.
